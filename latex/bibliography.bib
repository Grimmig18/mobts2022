@article{Ranaee.2013,
 abstract = {Control chart patterns (CCPs) are important statistical process control tools for determining whether a process is run in its intended mode or in the presence of unnatural patterns. This paper investigates the design of an efficient system for recognition of the control chart patterns. This system includes two main modules: a feature extraction module and a classification module. The feature extraction module extracts a combination set of the shape features and statistical features. In the classifier module, several multilayer perceptron neural networks with different number of layers and training algorithms are investigated. The performances of the networks for speed of convergence and accuracy classification are evaluated for six classes of the CCPs. Among the different training algorithms, the resilient back-propagation (RP) algorithm represented the best convergence rate and the Levenberg--Marquardt (LM) algorithm achieved the best overall detection accuracy.},

@article{Li.2016,
 abstract = {Visual attention is an attractive technique to derive important and prominent information from a scene in natural pictures. As a visual attention approach, spectral residual (SR) model is adapted to extract the residential regions from GF-1 satellite images in this paper. Specifically, we analyzed the impact of both different combinations of GF-1 satellite image bands and threshold algorithms on rural residential region detection. In addition, the adapted approach is compared with related visual attention methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative detection effectiveness. Experimental results showed that the SR model coupled with{\textless}italic{\textgreater} red{\textless}/italic{\textgreater},{\textless}italic{\textgreater} green,{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and{\textless}italic{\textgreater} blue{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} bands in GF-1 images and Otsu threshold algorithm achieved the best results and is suitable to quickly extract rural residential regions from GF-1 images.},

@article{Ahmed.2016,
 abstract = {Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has a great impact on social wellbeing, economic growth and national security in todays world. Generally, ICT includes computers, mobile communication devices and networks. ICT is also embraced by a group of people with malicious intent, also known as network intruders, cyber criminals, etc. Confronting these detrimental cyber activities is one of the international priorities and important research area. Anomaly detection is an important data analysis task which is useful for identifying the network intrusions. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of four major categories of anomaly detection techniques which include classification, statistical, information theory and clustering. The paper also discusses research challenges with the datasets used for network intrusion detection.},

@article{Sokolova.2009,
 abstract = {This paper presents a systematic analysis of twenty four performance measures used in the complete spectrum of Machine Learning classification tasks, i.e., binary, multi-class, multi-labelled, and hierarchical. For each classification task, the study relates a set of changes in a confusion matrix to specific characteristics of data. Then the analysis concentrates on the type of changes to a confusion matrix that do not change a measure, therefore, preserve a classifier's evaluation (measure invariance). The result is the measure invariance taxonomy with respect to all relevant label distribution changes in a classification problem. This formal analysis is supported by examples of applications where invariance properties of measures lead to a more reliable evaluation of classifiers. Text classification supplements the discussion with several case studies.},

@article{Luque.2019,
 abstract = {A major issue in the classification of class imbalanced datasets involves the determination of the most suitable performance metrics to be used. In previous work using several examples, it has been shown that imbalance can exert a major impact on the value and meaning of accuracy and on certain other well-known performance metrics. In this paper, our approach goes beyond simply studying case studies and develops a systematic analysis of this impact by simulating the results obtained using binary classifiers. A set of functions and numerical indicators are attained which enables the comparison of the behaviour of several performance metrics based on the binary confusion matrix when they are faced with imbalanced datasets. Throughout the paper, a new way to measure the imbalance is defined which surpasses the Imbalance Ratio used in previous studies. From the simulation results, several clusters of performance metrics have been identified that involve the use of Geometric Mean or Bookmaker Informedness as the best null-biased metrics if their focus on classification successes (dismissing the errors) presents no limitation for the specific application where they are used. However, if classification errors must also be considered, then the Matthews Correlation Coefficient arises as the best choice. Finally, a set of null-biased multi-perspective Class Balance Metrics is proposed which extends the concept of Class Balance Accuracy to other performance metrics.},
